  
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

An august summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so closed like brothers

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Dream away in the wind of change

Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Dream away in the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight to the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Share their dreams with you and me

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow
Dream away in the wind of change
